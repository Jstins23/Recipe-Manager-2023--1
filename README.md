# Recipe Manager(2023)
 
This is a systematic tool that will aid in managing recipes that you may like and potential tweaks you may make to them!

As someone who enjoys cooking, I often find myself searching through different cookbooks and websites to find new recipes to try. However, I struggle with keeping track of the recipes I've tried and enjoyed, as well as making modifications to recipes to suit my preference in taste. That's why I would like to create a Recipe Manager - a software tool that would allow users to easily search for, save, and modify recipes. The Recipe Manager would have several features, including a database of recipes that users can search through based on various criteria, such as ingredients, cooking time, and difficulty level. Users would be able to save their favorite recipes and make notes on modifications they've made to the original recipe. This software would be useful for home cooks of all skill levels, from beginners looking for easy recipes to experienced cooks looking to try new things.
